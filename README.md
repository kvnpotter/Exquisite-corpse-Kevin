Hello everyone, my name is Vivien and im here to share with you the tale of the secret chamber of Becentral.
It started on a friday, i was vomitting the tainted water from the "cofee machine". At this moment i knew i had to look and find the cofee stash, the real deal.
After oppening every single cabinet in the kitchen i knew i had to go further to complete this quest, and at this precise moment i heard a noise.

That is the alarm!
Good Morning !
